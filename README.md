# To-Do List Application

## Overview
This is a simple To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project was created as a learning exercise to understand various JavaScript concepts, including DOM manipulation, event handling, local storage, and modular code organization.

## Features

### Project Management
- Create and delete projects
- Select active project from a dropdown
- Projects persist using localStorage

### Task Management
- Add tasks with names and due dates
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- Delete tasks
- Filter tasks by:
  - All tasks
  - Active tasks
  - Completed tasks

### UI/UX
- Modal dialogs for adding projects and tasks
- Visual feedback for user actions
- Clean, intuitive interface

## Technical Concepts Learned

### JavaScript Fundamentals
- DOM manipulation (creating, updating, removing elements)
- Event handling (click, change events)
- Array methods (push, splice, forEach)
- Template literals for dynamic HTML
- Date/time handling

### Advanced Concepts
- localStorage for data persistence
- Modular code organization (separate files for projects, tasks, data)
- State management using global variables
- Event delegation patterns
- Dynamic element creation and styling
